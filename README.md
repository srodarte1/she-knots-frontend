&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-When prompted if you would like to start a server on another port press the <span style="color:#FF00FF">y</span> key  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.When you're done, close both servers by pressing <span style="color:#FF00FF">Ctrl+C</span> on both terminals.

## Zodiac Journal

is an interactive website created with the intention of being able to log how you are feeling and being able to keep your zodiac sign and traits & attributes in mind while doing so. General zodiac information comes from the Zodiac Signs API that was retieved [here](https://github.com/gnappo1/json-server-collection/blob/main/zodiac-signs/db.json) and stored locally for easy access and manipulation.

## Zodiac Journal

is a representation of what can be done when working with languages: _React_ using _React Router v.6_, _JavaScript_, _HTML_, and _CSS_ <!-- with some _Bootstrap_ -->. This web-based application utilizes several tools and features from these languages including _array interation_, _filtering_, _DOM/Server communication_, _routing_, and more.

When users of this application initially open the website they are greeted with a serene, welcoming homepage with all 12 zodiac signs listed to the left of the screen. Users can then scroll down to their zodiac and click on it to expand the information on the screen before mobing onto journaling. The links on the top left of the screen are used to navigate throughout the application to return to return to the home screen, move onto journaling, or view their own user-created journal entries.

For more information on what is included in the Zodiac Signs API please visit the github repository [here](https://github.com/gnappo1/json-server-collection/tree/main/zodiac-signs) or contact the developers listed below.
